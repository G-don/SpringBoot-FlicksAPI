##Description

This is Flicks, where you can leave your review on the list of available movies. Flicks was a challenging project where I built the backend and frontend and we all know the bugs we could catch... but I got them all!
I continued to develop my skills in React, Javascript and BootStrap for the frontend, Java, Spring Boot and MongoDB were the technologies used for the backend part of this programme.  

##Instructions

If you are cloning this project, you will need to

1 - Make sure you have a database to connect to. (I used MongoDB)
2 - Run the backend project (use the IDE of your choice)
3 - Run the frontend with the command: npm start (check the api folder and axiosconfig file and change the base URL if necessary)


##Features

Choose one of the available films and leave your review, remember it is anonymous at the moment but soon it will not be! So you can be honest and sincere in your reviews. 


##Visuals

To help you better understand the flow and functionality of Flicks, I have included a package of screenshots. These visuals will give you an insight into the application's interface and guide you through its features.

##ROADMAP

I will be adding new features to Flicks such as a register/login feature, and provide a bigger choice in terms of movies available to leave reviews.

##Contributing

Please feel free to send me your ideas or suggestions, feedback or feature requests or improvements, I would love to hear from you! 

##Licence

Flicks is released under the MIT licence.
